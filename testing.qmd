## Problem 1 - Vision

**a** Firstly, I use function **read.xport()** function to read XPT files. Then I use **inner_join()** function to combine these two files, using the SEQN variable for merging. It is showed that total sample size is now 6,980.
```{r}
# Use package "foreign" to read the XPT files
VIX_D <- read.xport("VIX_D.XPT")
DEMO_D <- read.xport("DEMO_D.XPT")

# Use function inner_join() to get the combined dataframe
# Show the row-number is 6980
Merged_data <- inner_join(VIX_D, DEMO_D, by = "SEQN")
nrow(Merged_data)
```

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this 

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
